# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This is the first oppurtunity we had to work with databases and deploy applications on a remote machine. We have included routes for both a users section and a clothing items section for our app. We created schemas and incorporated error handling throughout our controllers to improve user/dev experience throughtout this process.

In future updates we plan to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

This back-end project was tested using MongoDB and Postman throughout the development.
